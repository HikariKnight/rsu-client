runescape (3.9.9) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Added support for addons in the rsu-launcher and the rsu-client
    The functionality is disabled by default, to enable it.
    simply make a folder named "addons" inside the rsu-client's modules
    folder (if the client is installed from a repository then make
    the folder inside "~/.config/runescape/modules" instead)
  * Fixed several bugs in the rsu-launcher
  * Wrote a proper moduleloader.pl system
  * Made it possible for the rsu-launcher to launch perl script
    inside its own minimalistic wxperl environment, therefore saving
    space across platforms and make it possible to load perl scripts
    using wxwidgets2.9, without the libraries themselves.
  * Added support for running from /opt/extras.ubuntu.com

runescape (3.9.8) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Added support for using curl instead of wget
    (meaning either can be a dependency instead of the other)
  * Added support for using zenity in the update-runescape-client
    script, making the script more userfriendly thanks to Fallen Unia
  * Removed garbage collection parameters from the fallback parameters
    in the runescape script, however they are available in a comment
    below "$fallbackprms =" incase you need them.
  * update-runescape-client will now use zenity over xterm,
    however it will fallback to xterm if zenity is not installed.
  * Removed the option to launch the EoC beta from the local install
  * Added rsu-settings to the rightclick meny for runescape.desktop
    (Unity only)
  * Added perl based launchers instead of autoit based ones for windows

runescape (3.9.7) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Removed the need to redistribute perl manually on windows
    in order to make the client work.
  * Rewrote rsu-settings to work with the new PAR packaged
    scripts.
  * Removed the need to bundle an external version of perl
    on darwin/MacOSX just to get wxWidgets to work on that
    platform, this new method uses PAR to make a self contained
    loader that will include the necessary components to run
    wxperl with wxWidgets (saving hundreds of megabytes!).
  * Made a Launcher for the client, meaning less cluttered
    application menus for users. It is an optional module from 
    https://github.com/HikariKnight/rsu-launcher

runescape (3.5-0) maverick; urgency=high

  * Added support for overriding settings.conf through the launch
    command, this is useful if you want several .prm files and do not
    want to change settings constantly to enable and disable features.
    It is also useful for testing stuff. The syntax is 
    runescape --{settingsname}={value}
    As an example this will tell the client to use
    beta.prm as prm file and enable the forcealsa setting
    runescape --prmfile=beta.prm --forcealsa=true
    
  * Added a graphical settings tool for settings.conf and runescape.prm
    which is named rsu-settings
    It is an optional module which depends on libwx-perl and wxWidgets.
    It is however not required in order to run.
    The rsu-settings script is known to work on Linux, Windows and Mac
    
  * Updated the perl binaries i have to distribute to Windows users.
    The new version is perl-5.14.2
    
  * Created a perl binary bundle which MacOSX users needs to download
    in order to use the rsu-settings script, this is because Apple
    broke their own installation of wxPerl(libwx-perl) which is
    installed by default on MacOSX. And as I cannot expect
    Mac users to have xCode and the command line tools installed
    I created this bundle instead as a local install into the client
    directory(this also saves you 1-2 hours of compiling).
    This bundle will be downloaded if the rsu-settings
    is run on a MacOSX system that do not have the bundle downloaded.
    
  * Recompiled Download-Windows-Files.exe
    to fix a bug where it does not automatically replace files that
    it extracts when it downloads the win32.7z.
    
  * Updated the templates with new source and fixed the
    darwin template (MacOSX template) for the native launchers
    
  * Updated install-desktop-icons to include rsu-settings on MacOSX
  
  * Moved everything that extends the RSU Clients functionality into
    a new folder called modules, the only folder not moved there is
    the win32 folder.
    
  * Added a cleanupscript named cleanupscript.pl which will run
    on the first launch of the runescape script after you have
    updated the client (applies for the client installed from dropbox)
    
  * Added a runescape-beta.prm file to the share folder
    so that the client gets prepared for the public access to the
    RuneScape EOC beta
    
  * Added a right click option on the unity launcher to launch the
    client with the parameter --prmfile=runescape-beta.prm

runescape (3.4-0) maverick; urgency=high

  * Made the runescape script optimize java by running java in client
    mode rather than server mode if it is available (so far only
    available on 32-bit version of java), this fixes the lag you get
    when you have textures enabled in-game. Big thanks to Marshian for
    discovering this.
    
  * Made the client look if aoss32 exist if forcealsa=true and the
    -client parameter is available on the java binary.

runescape (3.1-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Prepared the client for distribution through repositories
    (make it aware of being run from read only locations)
    Please note that IF you are doing to make a repository for this client.
    It should be installed to /opt and then 
    /opt/runescape/runescape and /opt/runescape/update-runescape-client
    should be symlinked to /usr/bin
    Images from the clients share folder should then be symlinked to
    /usr/share/pixmaps or /usr/share/icons
    
  * update-runescape-client will not give the option to update scripts
    when installed on /opt, in order to update the scripts you have 2 options
    1. copy the runescape folder from /opt and into a location where your user
       have write permissions by default.
    2. or you can run /opt/runescape/update-scripts as root (not recommended!)
    
  * If the client is installed to /opt it will use ~/.config/runescape
    as the client folder, meaning you can still update jagexappletviewer.jar
    from jagex without waiting for the package maintainer!
    
  * Improved the unix_findlibrarypath function (BIG THANKS TO Jmb71 FOR THE NEW REGEX!)

  * AUR package will be released in the very near future (BIG THANKS TO Ker Laeda FOR THAT!)
    as i do not have Arch Linux, Ker Laeda have helped me a lot with the testing and preparations
    for the client to be distributed from a repository
    
  * Documentation.txt will be discontinued and the script themselves will
    contain the documentation in the comments instead 
    (however the file will still exist just to mention the sourcefiles are the documentation themselves)

runescape (3.0-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Thanks to Paul who reported to me that the client would not work
    if preferredjava was set to default-java and the java executable in
    $PATH was a script(or symlinked script) instead of a symlinked binary
    this would cause ldd to fail on what was supposed to be the binary and
    make the OpenGL fix not work or make the client fail to launch alltogether.
    
    A workaround for this have been made for systems that are affected (namely gentoo and sabayon)
    in which a message will be displayed and show the user how to set the client
    to use a custom java binary, this will solve this issue on these affected systems.
    This message will ONLY be triggered if preferredjava is not set or is set to default-java!
    
  * Updated settings.conf.example with a custom java path example :)

runescape (2.8-1) lucid; urgency=low
  * Made the update-runescape-client ASK if it is ok to download and compile
    p7zip-full if it is not detected, this was done by request from one of the
    players who were concerned that it happened without permission.
    I guess i focused so much on compability that i forgot my manners.
    I am sorry that it happened, hope you all can forgive me :)
    
  * update-runescape-client script now gives more info if the 7z binary is not found,
    this will make it easier to know what packages are missing! :)

  * Added a forcealsa option which will force java to use the alsa sound server,
    this will make sounds far more stable on linux and they will not disappear randomly
    like they do with pulseaudio. This function requires alsa and alsa-aoss to be installed.
    
  * Changed the fallback parameters (incase a prm file is not found) to

runescape (2.0-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Replaced the default java app icon in the dock on MacOSX
  * Added "RuneScape Unix Client" as the app name in the MacOSX dock
  * Added -Xdebug to the runescape.prm so that java shows some debug
    info when the client is executed from the terminal.
  * added -d64 parameter to runescape.prm to let the client use the
    64-bit data model (in theory it means running the client in 64bit mode)

runescape (1.9-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Added version info to the runescape script so you can find the version
    by calling the script with the --version parameter
  * Added a help text for the new parameters in the runescape script.
    Just execute runescape with --help to view it.
  * Added verbose modes for java so that we may get other helpful info about crashes
    were the normal debug output from the script is not enough.
    Parameters added are --verbose, --verbose:gc, --verbose:class and --verbose:jni
    the --verbose parameter is the same as all the other 3 together.

runescape (1.7-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Added the documentation of the project, the same documentation
    that have been sent to Jagex since November 2011.
  * Added support for running java inside padsp which will force java to use PulseAudio
    which will fix most sound related issues with the client, but it is disabled
    by default incase the system does not have padsp installed.
  * Moved all settings for the client to share/settings.conf
  * Added a readconf($key, $default) function to the runescape script.
  * Added support for changing the prm file to use (see prmfile in settings.conf)

runescape (1.6-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Fixed the extraction issue with p7zip on MacOSX

runescape (1.5-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Added a variable at the top of the runescape file(line 38) that lets you
    choose the version of java you would prefer to use on linux.
    Thanks to Piece Maker from the runescape forums for confirming my suspicion about the openjdk7 regression.
    
    Choices available are: 6-openjdk, 7-openjdk, openjdk, default-java or a path to the java binary file
    
    default-java will make the client use the java located in $PATH or set by update-alternatives
    openjdk will make the script use the newest version of openjdk it will find
    6-openjdk and 7-openjdk will force the client to use the openjdk version you ser (either 6 or 7)
    A path to a java binary could be "/opt/java/jre1.6_29/jre/bin/java" (can be used to force client to use sun/oracle java)
    
    NOTE: you can change the default java for your unix system by running
    sudo update-alternatives --config java
    It is however not recommended to run the client in openjdk7 due to a regression
    in its OpenGL mode and Software mode (not sure if this affects windows users too)

runescape (1.4-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Removed the need for strawberry perl for windows when using compability/wine mode
    (reducing the size of the unix client to almost nothing again)
  * Fixed a bug causing the compabilitymode to not exit when you close the window
  * Create a smaller installer that just install/uninstall the .desktop files

runescape (1.3-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * The runescape file will now write debug info to the terminal if
    it is run from the shell, with > /dev/null or > /path/to/logfile.txt
    or >> /path/to/logfile.txt
  * Fixed a bug, if you had 2 versions of openjdk installed, the
    oldest one would be used instead of the newest.
  * Fixed a bug where 7-zip did not get compiled correctly on systems
    without p7zip-full installed
  * Added a compabilitymode which uses java from wine(AT NEAR NATIVE PERFORMANCE!).
    This can be used to provide the runescape client for systems
    that are unable to update their java installations.
    It can also work for linux distros that have problems activating OpenGL mode!
    You can activate this by passing --compabilitymode to the runescape file
    or edit "my $compabilitymode = 0;" to "my $compabilitymode = 1;"
    at the begining of the runescape file.

runescape (1.2-0) lucid; urgency=low
  * Proxy support (http, https and socks) just edit the 
    share/runescape.prm file.
  * Client updater that will fetch new client files from jagex
    by your own command. Just run "Runescape Client Updater" from
    the start menu.
  * If your system do not have 7zip/p7zip installed, the updater
    will download and compile it and add it to the client for future
    use when you run the updater for the first time.
    It will store 1 7zip binary for each platform and architecture
    you have run the updater on.
    (example: 7za-linux-i386, 7za-freebsd-x86_64, 7za-linux-x86_64)
