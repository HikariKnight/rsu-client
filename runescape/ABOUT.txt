This runescape client is put together by HikariKnight
to create a completely crossplatform runescape client that can be run
without installation on any platform. 

And on platforms not supported by Jagex, it is possible to install the 
client too.

The client files are from the windows/mac client for runescape.

The "runescape" perl script is written by HikariKnight, but is based on
Ethoxyethaan's shellscript to run the runescape windows client natively,
I just polished it and fixed language support and added proxy support :)
And I made it easy to apply known fixes to the client.

The "compabilitymode" is used to run the client through java in wine
only if compabilitymode is activated in the settings.conf file located in the
share folder.
Or by passing --compabilitymode to the runescape file when launching it.
The compabilitymode requires the sun/oracle java(windows version of java)
to be installed inside wine from http://java.com

Got any questions? just leave a comment on my page :)
