With version 4.3.4 of the RSU-Client you can now add
custom client window icons!

To do this just make a new prm file and name it for example:
runescape_custom.prm

Now go to the client's share/img folder and create a folder named
runescape_custom

Inside this new folder you place a PNG file that you want to use as
the icon for the client window and name it:
jagexappletviewer.png
or just jagexappletviewer if you have file extensions hidden.

If no folder for a prm is detected it will default to the RuneScape3 folder.

NOTE: Some prm files have hardcoded icon folders! These are:
runescape.prm
oldschool.prm
rsdarkscape.prm
darkscape.prm
runescape_darkscape.prm
and all the prm files starting with "funorb_"
