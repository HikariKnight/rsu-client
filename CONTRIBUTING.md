# Contributing to RSU-Client

## Getting Started

To contribute, you need a [Github account](https://github.com/signup/free). This will allow you to submit a *pull request* (code modifications), or an *issue* (bug report).
If you don't want to submit your code on Github, send a message to [RSCommunityTech](http://www.youtube.com/user/RSCommunityTech). 

## Submitting a Bug or Suggestion

- Clearly describe your bug/suggestion with as much detail as possible (the more the better!)

## Making Changes

- We suggest creating a branch to work from. Your master branch should refect our master branch.
- Be sure that your commit message does an appropriate job of explaing your pull request
- Document your code appropriately. It is important that if someone else is reading your code, that they can quickly understand what it is doing.

## Submitting Changes

- Go into GitHub and submit a [pull request!](http://help.github.com/send-pull-request/) to the *development* branch of the rsu-client repository.
- Add any comments about your code before submitting. 
- Don't forget to add your name or nickname to AUTHORS.md

## After Submitting a Pull Request

- After submitting a pull request, anything you commit to the branch that was used when you submitted the pull request *will* be automatically added to the pull request. This is why we suggested creating a new branch to work from! 
- Don't forget you can modify your pull request at any time by publishing a commit to the same branch that the pull request originated from.
